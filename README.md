# Equal-Weight-class
Algorithm that automatically calculates the number of units of a financial asset to be purchased to obtain an equal-weight version of an index fund.
Suppose there is a fund that has millions of dollars under management in only 9 assets (BTC-USD, ETH-USD, USDT-USD, BNB-USD, USDC-USD, BUSD-USD, XRP-USD, ADA-USD, DOGE-USD).
This class called "equal weight" calculated the number of units of the asset to be purchased to get an equal weight version of an index fund.
